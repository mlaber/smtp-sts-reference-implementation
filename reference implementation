  1.Introduction
  
    SMTP-STS prevents TLS secured SMTP transmissions from possible downgrade attacks by validating a defined policy which describes the expected TLS behavior and other security relevant parameters for the domain.
    Therefor sending and receiving MTAs have to interpret the DNS referenced SMTP-STS policy and construct automatic MTA specific rules and configuration.
    
    This reference implementation uses the commonly used open source MTA 'Exim' without any modifications.
    
    
  3. Description of the test bed
  
    The test bed consists of three hosts:
    
     	alice.sts-test.org 		217.160.15.201
	bob.sts-test.org 		217.160.13.217	
	mallory.sts-test.org 		212.227.8.129
	    
    Each server runs a MTA. Alice an Bob represent communication partners A/B and simulate regular SMTP-STS secured mail transfers. Mallory simulates possible STARTTLS downgrade attacks and other STS policy violations.
    The hosts reply to an echo@$HOSTNAME mail with a dump of the mail header and other relevant debug information.
