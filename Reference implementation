  1.Introduction
    SMTP-STS prevents TLS secured SMTP Transmissions from possible downgrade attacks by validating a defined policy which describes the expected TLS behavior and other securit relevant parameters for the domain.
    Therefore sending and receiving MTA have to interpret the DNS referenced SMTP-STS policy and construct automatic MTA specific rules and configuration.
    This reference implementaion uses the commonly uses open source MTA exim without any modifications.
    
    
  3. Description of the test bed
    The test bed consists actual of three Hosts:
    
     	alice.sts-test.org 		  217.160.15.201
	    bob.sts-test.org 		    217.160.13.217	
	    mallory.sts-test.org 		212.227.8.129
	    
	    Each server runs an MTA. Alice an bob represent communication partner A/B and simulate regular SMTP-STS secured mail transfers. Mallory simulates possible STARTTLS downgrade attacks and other STS policy violations.
	    The host reply to echo@$HOSTNAME mail with a dump of the mail header and other relevant debug information.
